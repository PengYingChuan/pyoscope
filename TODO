TODO

   * File dump mode for one or two traces
   * Test with 1102CD scope (older firmware)
   * Try firmware upgrade?
   * Plotting routines (in wxFrame?, direct to EPS/PNG)

Should the RigolScope object hold the most recently acquired data for use by processing routines?  For example the plotting object can be linked to RigolScope object for message passing.

Which RigolScope methods should be part of the public interface and which are private?
